The Power Of Persuasion
How empathy and sincerity work wonders for you
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The more effective you are at communicating, the greater your changes of being successful at persuasion
- Aristotle's art of persiasion
	- "The art of getting poeple to do something they wouldn't ordinarily do if you didn't ask"
	- Three approaches: 
		- Ethos: (ethical - character, reputation)
			1. Must relate to the speaker's character 
			2. Must have a source of credibility
			3. Refers to the sincerity that excludes from the individual
		- Pathos: (emotional appeal)
			1. To stir emtion, you must show, have and understand empathy
		- Logos: (logical)
			1. Actual words used by the speaker
			2. Choice of words, use of stories, facts, and quatations 
	- The best approach strike a blend of all three
		-> Aristotole said: Logos as primary, Ethos and Pathos as secondary 
		-> Modern: Ethos as primary, Logos and Ethos as secondary
		-> Once you have trust (ethos) established, you must use Logic (Logos) and Emotion (Pathos) to get through
	- Use the conscious and unconscious route
		-> Logic on the conscious mind, pathos on the unconscious 
		-> If a person feels well disposed to the persuaded (ethos), they are more likely to make a desicion based on pathos, then back
			up this decision by going over the facts 
			-> Logic is used to 'validate' the decision we make
	- Empathy
		- Pathos = Having the perception to ascetain another person's true feelings that you deal with, lead to better relationships
		- Empathy is the ability to identify and understand another person's feelings, ideas, and situation
	- Try using empathy to read minds of people you deal with 
	- When people feels theres a sincere desire by another person to feel how they feel, an initial rapport develops.
		-> This increases the chances of them being open to your ideas
	- Sincerity
		- Sincerity is essential if you want to develop empathy, but it is not enough, you also need trust
		- Everything you do, either promotes or lessons trust in a relationship
		- Trust occurs between people, and not within people
		- The conveying of trust to another person is whats important
		- You need to show genuine sincerity of people's problems to get you to a higher plane of trust
			- The person will be more receptive to your questions, and tell you more
			- This allows you to stir the conversation more
		- The more supportive you are to another person, the more likely they are to disclose their thoughts, ideas, and feelings to you
			-> Its a circular relationship, the more trustworthy you are in response to these 'self-discloures', the deeper and more personal will
			be the thoughts that the person shares with you
		- Empathy + Sincerity = Persuasion (ESP)
			- Good communication is vital too 
	- Interpersonal Intelligence:
		- An understanding of other people, how they feel, their likes and dislikes, their motivations
		- The perosn with this ability, should be able to predict how others will act and is .:. able to interact with the eddectively
	- Intrapersonal Intelligence
		- Insight into our own thought proceseses and feelings, and emotions, and awarness of the causes and consequences of our actions
- We all have an aversion to being manipulated, thats not what gentle persuasion is.
- Persuasion is about communicating in a way that results in favourable outcomes
- "Man's inability to communicate is a result of his failure to listen effectively, skilfully, and with understading to another person"
