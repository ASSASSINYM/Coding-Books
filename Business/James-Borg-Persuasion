The Power Of Persuasion
How empathy and sincerity work wonders for you
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The more effective you are at communicating, the greater your changes of being successful at persuasion
- Aristotle's art of persiasion
	- "The art of getting poeple to do something they wouldn't ordinarily do if you didn't ask"
	- Three approaches: 
		- Ethos: (ethical - character, reputation)
			1. Must relate to the speaker's character 
			2. Must have a source of credibility
			3. Refers to the sincerity that excludes from the individual
		- Pathos: (emotional appeal)
			1. To stir emtion, you must show, have and understand empathy
		- Logos: (logical)
			1. Actual words used by the speaker
			2. Choice of words, use of stories, facts, and quatations 
	- The best approach strike a blend of all three
		-> Aristotole said: Logos as primary, Ethos and Pathos as secondary 
		-> Modern: Ethos as primary, Logos and Ethos as secondary
		-> Once you have trust (ethos) established, you must use Logic (Logos) and Emotion (Pathos) to get through
	- Use the conscious and unconscious route
		-> Logic on the conscious mind, pathos on the unconscious 
		-> If a person feels well disposed to the persuaded (ethos), they are more likely to make a desicion based on pathos, then back
			up this decision by going over the facts 
			-> Logic is used to 'validate' the decision we make
	- Empathy
		- Pathos = Having the perception to ascetain another person's true feelings that you deal with, lead to better relationships
		- Empathy is the ability to identify and understand another person's feelings, ideas, and situation
	- Try using empathy to read minds of people you deal with 
	- When people feels theres a sincere desire by another person to feel how they feel, an initial rapport develops.
		-> This increases the chances of them being open to your ideas
	- Sincerity
		- Sincerity is essential if you want to develop empathy, but it is not enough, you also need trust
		- Everything you do, either promotes or lessons trust in a relationship
		- Trust occurs between people, and not within people
		- The conveying of trust to another person is whats important
		- You need to show genuine sincerity of people's problems to get you to a higher plane of trust
			- The person will be more receptive to your questions, and tell you more
			- This allows you to stir the conversation more
		- The more supportive you are to another person, the more likely they are to disclose their thoughts, ideas, and feelings to you
			-> Its a circular relationship, the more trustworthy you are in response to these 'self-discloures', the deeper and more personal will
			be the thoughts that the person shares with you
		- Empathy + Sincerity = Persuasion (ESP)
			- Good communication is vital too 
	- Interpersonal Intelligence:
		- An understanding of other people, how they feel, their likes and dislikes, their motivations
		- The perosn with this ability, should be able to predict how others will act and is .:. able to interact with the eddectively
	- Intrapersonal Intelligence
		- Insight into our own thought proceseses and feelings, and emotions, and awarness of the causes and consequences of our actions
- We all have an aversion to being manipulated, thats not what gentle persuasion is.
- Persuasion is about communicating in a way that results in favourable outcomes
- "Man's inability to communicate is a result of his failure to listen effectively, skilfully, and with understading to another person"

Being a Good Listener
Why listening is so crucial
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- We think much faster than we can speak
- Of all aspects of communication, listening is the most important
- If you;re a bad listener, people will become frustrated by you
- Listening is far more than just being quiet when somebody else speaks
- The compulsion to speak in many cases, devalues the function of listening
- Mastering the art of listening is crucial to success 
- Active listening is hard, and requires a lot of concentration, you have to be alert
- People are impressed by good listeners, but rarely make the effor themslves to adopt this skill
- Listening is a sign of affirmation
	- It promotes self-essteem
- "You should have heard him listen"
- It pays good dividends if you listen
	- It establishs you as a friend, and that makes for a more mutual understanding in a business relationship
- If you listen carefully, you can pick up all sorts of information about the idiosyncrasies of an organisaion, and the individual you are dealing
	with
- People who are poor listeners see listening as passive, and therefore of no use,
	- Its see as unproductive, and their ego gets in the way
	- They feel the need to be talking to make an impact on another person
- Running Tapes in your own head
	- To listen productively, try to remove all distractions from your mind
	- Concentrate on the speaker
	- Preoccupation or lack of interest impedes effective listening

- LISTENING IS ABOUT DERIVING MEANING FROM WHAT IS BEING SAID NOT JUST HEARING

- "I hear what you say"
	- Hearing is a natural procuess which happens automatically
	- Listening is a psychologicla process, of interpreting and understanding what people say

- We think much faster than we can speak (Approx 5 times as fast)
	-> Because of this, we tend to think about other things and not just about what is being said 
	-> The listener is always ahead of the person doing the talking
	-> This makes it easy to lose concentration
	-> All communication either drives forward or backwards the relationship between people, the way you listen and respond to other people is paramount in promoting the relationship
	-> By listening empathatically, you are signalling "I am interested in everything you are saying, and am eager to understand your point of view"
	-> By failing to listen and responding the wrong way, you are saying the opposite

- How do we listen in the right Fashion?
	
	- Don't interupt 
		-> Because we think so much faster, there is the temptation to interupt
		-> This signals that we are not listening, or you are eager to side track the speaker's line of reasoning
		-> If you do this, they are less likely to listen intently when you speak
		-> Interupting doesn't produce the required outcome (don't play to win, play to be invited back)
		-> You can interupt with excitement of their topic, and allows the speaker to continue 
			-> An irritating interuption causes the speaker to use flow and rhythem, and the convverstation is taken over
	
	- Don't finish other people's sentences 
		-> Bad form, as the speaker doesn't feel incontrol of their ideas
		-> On the odd occasion, it shows you are listening, but don't make a habit of it
		-> You can also guess the wrong ending  (they might not even tell you you;re wrong)
		-> Can also give the other person doubts about you that weren't already there

	- Don't talk over the other person
		-> Signals "I don't care about what you;re going to say, my thing is better"
		-> This also leads to one upping each other in a converstation

	- Offering Advice too soon
		-> comes from a desire to help
		-> You cut the speaker off, and take the conversation down your line of enquiry 
		-> The speakers have more to get off their chest, and you've cut them off too soon
		-> By not listening, there is a tendancy to make up meaning of what is being said 

	- Paraphrasing
		-> It lets the speark see the ideas and feelings why have oncenyed from the other person's point of view
		-> Don't add to the message, you send back the meaning you received 
		-> You assure the sender that you are trying to understand the basis of their thoughts and feelings
		-> We have a much better chance of persuading people if we understand their reasoning, and make an educated guess at the way they are 	thinking

- Best trait to have: Not only FEEL, but be FASCINATED by what the speaker has to say, and truly listen and derive meaning from what they are saying
- Its a charasmatic trait
People want to listen to us too, so getting their attention and asking the right questions are important.
